# Flask-Hrodna-History

This project is an **unfinished and early-stage** Flask application, originally conceived in September 2022 as part of a school project. It does not provide any real functionality or value in its current state.

## Original Idea

The initial concept for "Flask-Hrodna-History" was to create a web application focused on the historical aspects of Hrodna (Grodno), a city in Belarus. The goal was to provide a platform for users to explore articles and information related to the city's rich history, potentially featuring interactive timelines, historical articles, and a content management system for administrators.

Although this is not my first Flask project, it stands out as the only one from that period that was managed with Git. Earlier projects, such as a messenger application using WebSockets and a blog app, were much more developed but were not version-controlled and therefore are not available. While incomplete, this repository still represents an important step in my learning journey with Python and Flask.

## Project Status

**Status: Inactive / Incomplete**

This project is currently not under active development. It is a very basic skeleton and lacks many core features that would be necessary for a functional application, including proper routing, user authentication, a complete database schema, and comprehensive templates.

## Installation

To set up this project locally (for examination purposes only, as it's not functional):

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-hrodna-history.git
    cd flask-hrodna-history
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The `requipments` folder contains several `requirements.txt` files. For a basic setup, you might try:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requipments/base.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Dependencies might be outdated or insufficient for a complete Flask application, given the project's age.)*

## Usage

This project is not currently functional and cannot be used for its intended purpose. On the main page, it will most likely display only a single article that was written at the time by my geography teacher, Denis Viktorovich Beletskiy.
